My objective is to get multiple sprites utilized as enemies, and for them to spawn at random. # of intended enemy sprites:
  around 5.
  
I did originally intend to allow a "final enemy" to spawn at the conclusion of the game, which would require prior 
  enemies to be removed while offering no rewards on their removal. 
  
The player sprite is intended to be something else.

The method I've thought of in creating the enemy regular > to final enemy scenario is incorporating a scoring system
  which allocates static # of points on enemy death, and when a particular score is hit, wipe the board, and spawn the
  final enemy, which will likely kill the player and we'll call it a day. 

A border is desired to be created around the play-board so the edges are easy to see.

// 
That's about it! 
Have a great day!
